            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Answer in 100-120 words each.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Discuss the impact of globalization on developing countries.<br>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <strong>Expected Answer:</strong> Globalization has boosted trade and technology access in developing countries, fostering economic growth (e.g., India’s IT sector). However, it has also widened inequality, exploited labor, and eroded cultural identities due to Western influence.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>Analyze the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security.<br>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <strong>Expected Answer:</strong> The UN mediates conflicts (e.g., Cyprus peacekeeping), imposes sanctions, and authorizes interventions. Its effectiveness is limited by veto power in the Security Council and lack of enforcement mechanisms.

                <li>Explain the challenges faced by India during the era of one-party dominance.<br>

                        <strong>Expected Answer:</strong> From 1947-1967, Congress dominance faced challenges like opposition weakness, internal factionalism, and managing diversity (language, caste), yet it ensured stability and nation-building.

                </li>
                <li>Compare and contrast the foreign policies of India and China with their neighbors.<br>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <strong>Expected Answer:</strong> India emphasizes non-alignment and peaceful coexistence (e.g., Panchsheel with China), while China pursues assertive policies (e.g., Belt and Road). Both seek regional influence but differ in approach—India diplomatic, China economic/military.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>Evaluate the effectiveness of the Indian Constitution in addressing social inequalities.<br>
                    <div class="answer">

            <h2 class="section-title">Section E: Long Answer Questions (10 Marks)</h2>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Answer in 150-200 words each.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Critically analyze the role of political parties in Indian democracy.<br>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <strong>Expected Answer:</strong> Political parties are vital to Indian democracy, mobilizing voters, forming governments, and shaping policies. Congress dominated initially, ensuring stability, while multi-party systems later reflected diversity (e.g., BJP, regional parties). However, issues like corruption, dynastic politics, and vote-bank strategies weaken democratic values. Their role in coalition governments shows adaptability but often compromises governance efficiency.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>Discuss the impact of coalition politics on governance in India.<br>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <strong>Expected Answer:</strong> Coalition politics, prominent since the 1990s, reflects India’s diversity but complicates governance. It ensures broader representation (e.g., NDA, UPA) but leads to policy delays, compromises, and instability due to conflicting interests. While it curbs authoritarianism, it often prioritizes political survival over development.
