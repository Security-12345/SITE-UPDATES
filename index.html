        <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
        <div class="answer">The Cold War ended due to:<br>- The economic and military exhaustion of the Soviet Union, which could no longer sustain the arms race with the USA.<br>- Internal reforms like Gorbachev’s Glasnost (openness) and Perestroika (restructuring), which weakened the Soviet system and led to its disintegration by 1991.</div>

        <div class="answer">Shock Therapy refers to the sudden transition from a socialist to a capitalist economy in post-Soviet states after 1991. In Russia, it involved rapid privatization and market liberalization. Its impacts included:<br>- Economic collapse, with industries disappearing and inflation soaring.<br>- Increased poverty and inequality, creating a divide between rich oligarchs and the poor.<br>- Weakened state control, leading to corruption and instability.<br>- Loss of social welfare systems, making life harder for citizens.</div>

        <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
        <div class="answer">Yes, I agree. Regional demands reflect India’s diversity while reinforcing unity:<br>- <strong>Linguistic States:</strong> Formation of states like Andhra Pradesh (1953) based on language preserved cultural identity within a united India.<br>- <strong>Northeast Autonomy:</strong> Granting autonomy to states like Nagaland balances regional aspirations with national integrity.<br>- <strong>Federal Structure:</strong> Power-sharing through federalism accommodates diverse demands (e.g., Tamil Nadu’s language protests) without breaking unity.<br>However, excessive demands (e.g., separatism in Kashmir) sometimes challenge unity, though resolved through dialogue, showing India’s strength in managing diversity.</div>
